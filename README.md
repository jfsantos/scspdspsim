This is an adaptation of the SCSP DSP interpreter implemented in [aosdk](https://github.com/nmlgc/aosdk) with added debugging information to help understand DSP code dumps from the Linker tool provided in the Sega Saturn SDK. It does a disassembly of sorts by explaining what each step in the program does (since SEGA never released the instruction set or operands for the DSP, I guess this is the second best thing we can have).

Future features:
- [ ] Test DSP code on PCM audio
